# Life_Day

It used Weather api in swift with Alaomfire and SwiftyJson.

It is my first work.

Please understand that this software is my first personal project that Iâ€™ve ever created, and experienced programmers may find my code to be sloppy.

If you want sample code of Alamofire and SwiftyJson, it will help you.

But, It is written in Korean.
