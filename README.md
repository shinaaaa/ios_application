# Life_Day

It used Weather api in swift with Alaomfire and SwiftyJson.

It is my first work.

Please understand that this software is my first personal project that I’ve ever created, and experienced programmers may find my code to be sloppy.

If you want sample code of Alamofire and SwiftyJson, it will help you.

But, It is written in Korean.

These pictures are screenshot in my iphone6S while running application.

The weather forecast is received by the Korea Meteorological Administration.

Icon_sun changes according to the weather forecast.

The weather forecast reflects the current location.

I used CLLocationManager and Mapkit in swift.

But the Korea Meteorological Administration used special coordinate system.

So, I got an idea from "https://gist.github.com/fronteer-kr/14d7f779d52a21ac2f16"

Thank you for your visit.

I want your feedback.
